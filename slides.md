# Static or Dynamic?

Static: type cannot change at runtime

> types are associated with a variable declaration 

Dynamic: type can determined at runtime

> It's also very dynamic as it rarely uses what it knows to limit variable usage. In Python, it's the program's responsibility to use built-in functions like isinstance() and issubclass() to test variable types and correct usage.

## Static or Dynamic -- Languages

- Dynamic
  - **Python\***
  - Ruby
  - Clojure
  - JavaScript
- Static
  - C/C++
  - Rust
  - Java
  - TypeScript

---

## Static or Dynamic -- Examples

Python
```python
>>> thing = 42
>>> type(thing)
<class 'int'>
>>> thing = 'hello'  # wow, so dynamic 😮
>>> type(thing)
<class 'str'>
```

Java
```java
var thing = 42;             // Java 10 introduced var
System.out.println(thing);
thing = "hello";            // I've got a bad feeling about this...
System.out.println(thing);
```

```bash
Main.java:5: error: incompatible types: String cannot be converted to int
    thing = "hello";
```

---

# Strong or Weak?

Strong

> restrictive about how types can be intermingled

Weak

> in a weakly typed language a compiler / interpreter will sometimes change the type of a variable

https://wiki.python.org/moin/Why%20is%20Python%20a%20dynamic%20language%20and%20also%20a%20strongly%20typed%20language

---

## Strong or Weak -- Languages

- Strong
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Java
  - Clojure
- Weak
  - C/C++
  - JavaScript

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_programming_languages_by_type_system

---

## Strong or Weak -- Examples

Python 💪
```python
>>> foo = 42
>>> bar = 'no thank you'
>>> foo + bar
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

JavaScript
```javascript
foo = 42
bar = 'yes please'
foo + bar
```

```
> 42yes please  // booo 👎
```

# Review

Python is **strongly** typed because it restricts how types interact and **dynamically** typed becuase types are determined and can change at runtime.

---

# Duck Typing 🦆

> A programming style which does not look at an object’s type to determine if it has the right interface; instead, the method or attribute is simply called or used (“If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck.”) 

https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-duck-typing

## Nominal vs. Structual subtyping

Nominal: If `Foo` inherits from `Var`, we've **named** our supertype `Bar`.

Structural: `Foo` is a subtype of `Bar` because its structure matches `Bar`.

# Tour de `typing` 🚲

---

# [`typing.Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any)

You're _technically_ using type hints

> A static type checker will treat every type as being compatible with Any and Any as being compatible with every type.

Examples: see `examples/any.py`

https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#the-any-type

---

# [`typing.Any`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Any) -- cont'd

```python
from typing import Any

thing: Any = 1
thing = 2                       # this is fine
thing = 'hello'                 # this is fine, too
thing = { 'foo': 'bar' }        # totally fine with this
thing = lambda foo: foo.bar()   # super fine
```

```python
def some_function(data):
    return data

def some_typed_function(data: Any) -> Any:
    return data

```

---

# [`typing.Union`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Union)

```python
StringOrNone = Union[str, None]

string: StringOrNone = 'foo'
none: StringOrNone = None
not_string_or_none: StringOrNone = 42  # <- error
```

```python
Number = Union[int, float]
def multiply(left: Number, right: Number) -> Number:
    return left * right

multiply(5, 10.0)
```

---

# [`typing.Callable`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Callable)

```python
def call_this_funky_func(func):
    return func()

call_this_funky_func(5)  # <- TypeError: 'int' object is not callable
```

```python
from typing import Callable

def call_this_typed_funky_func(func: Callable[..., int]):
    return func()

call_this_typed_funky_func(5)  # <- Type "Literal[5]" cannot be assigned to type "(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> int"
call_this_typed_funky_func(lambda: 5)
```

```python
def call_this_other_typed_funky_func(func: Callable[[int, int], int]):
    # do some more interesting stuff...
    x = 5
    y = 10
    return func(x, y)

call_this_other_typed_funky_func(lambda x, y: x ** y)
```

---

# [`typing.Literal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Literal)

```python
from typing import Literal

JoeOrJoseph = Literal['joe', 'joseph']

def only_joe_or_joseph(value: JoeOrJoseph):
    return f'Hi {value}!'

only_joe_or_joseph('joe')
only_joe_or_joseph('not joseph')  # <- error
```

---

# [`typing.TypeVar`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeVar)

> Type variables exist primarily for the benefit of static type checkers. They serve as the parameters for generic types as well as for generic function definitions.

```python
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')
A = TypeVar('A', str, bytes)  # Must be str or bytes
```

---

# [`typing.Generic`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Generic)

```python
from typing import Generic, TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T')

class CacheService(Generic[T]):

    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.cache = {}

    def get(self, key) -> T:
        return self.cache[key]

    def set(self, key, value: T) -> None:
        self.cache[key] = value
```

---

# [`typing.Generic`](typed_cache_service) -- cont'd

```python
any_cache_service = CacheService()
any_cache_service.set('foo', 'bar')
foo = any_cache_service.get('foo')  # can't tell what foo is

typed_cache_service = CacheService[str]()
typed_cache_service.set('foo', 'bar')
foo = typed_cache_service.get('foo')  # foo is a str
```

---

# [`typing.Protocol`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Protocol)

> I _need_ my duck typing!

Similar idea to [mixins](https://medium.com/flutter-community/dart-what-are-mixins-3a72344011f3).

```python
from typing import Protocol

# some other module
class Duck():
    def speak(self):
        return 'Quack!'

# our module
class Speaks(Protocol):
    def speak(self) -> str: ...

def speak_louder(speaker: Speaks) -> str:
    return speaker.speak().upper() + '!'

speak_louder(Duck()) # <-- notice how Duck does not nominally inherit from Speaks
```

---

# [`typing.Optional`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Optional)

```python
from typing import Optional

def square(item: Optional[int]):
    if item is None:
        return None
    return item ** 2

result = square(2)  # int | None
```

Bummer, I don't want to do a `None` check for every result...

---

# [`typing.overload`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.overload)

```python
from typing import Optional, overload

@overload
def square(item: None) -> None: ...

@overload
def square(item: int) -> int: ...

def square(item: Optional[int]):
    if item is None:
        return None
    return item ** 2

result = square(2)     # int
result = square(None)  # None
```

---

# [`typing.cast`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast)

```python
from typing import cast

my_config = get_config_var('my_config')
reveal_type(my_config)  # Any -- note: reveal_type is from mypy

my_config = cast(
    Dict[str, int],
    get_config_var('my_config'),
)
reveal_type(my_config)  # Dict[str, int]
```

# Note

> This module defines several types that are subclasses of pre-existing standard library classes which also extend Generic to support type variables inside []. These types became redundant in Python 3.9 when the corresponding pre-existing classes were enhanced to support [].
> 
> The **redundant types are deprecated as of Python 3.9** but no deprecation warnings will be issued by the interpreter. It is expected that type checkers will flag the deprecated types when the checked program targets Python 3.9 or newer.
> 
> The deprecated types will be removed from the typing module in the first Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0. See details in PEP 585—Type Hinting Generics In Standard Collections.

< 3.9
```python
from typing import Tuple

str_and_int: Tuple[str, int] = ('foo', 42)
```

\>= 3.9

str_and_int: tuple[str, int] = ('foo', 42)
